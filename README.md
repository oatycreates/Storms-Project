# Storms-Project

Take to the skies in a beautiful sky world!

The floating islands are beginning to slowly crumble and this once serene world is in danger.

Manoeuvre your mighty airship through the air and collect the terrified passengers.

Will you be able to safely return them to your base, or will the cannon fire of enemy players dislodge them from your craft, sending them plummeting into the abyss below?

Being worked on by: Andy, Ello, Harry, Pat, Row, and Rowan.
