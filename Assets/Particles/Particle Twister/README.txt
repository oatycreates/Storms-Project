- PARTICLE TWISTER:

Easily create wild twister/tornado/cyclone/spiral particle systems with this tool!

Open up the editor window from the menu bar: Window -> Mirza Beig -> Particle Twister. 

The fastest way to see results is to simply create a new twister ParticleSystem. The tool will add a new
GameObject to the scene root named, "Twister", and it will have a pre-configured ParticleSystem component attached to it.

Click it in the hierarchy and you can start customizing it just like you would any other Shuriken particle system.

Alternatively, select any ACTIVE GameObject(s) in the scene that have at least one ACTIVE ParticleSystem component in their hierarchy.
You can start adjusting the twister settings and they will be applied immediately by default (Auto-Update: ON) to all valid selections.

Finally, you can play around with the included prefab and give it a run in the sample demo scene.
It uses textures from my particle systems and texture/material asset package, the "VFX Particle Pack". See below!

** MAKE SURE TO READ THE TOOLTIPS!

- VFX PARTICLE PACK:

LO-RES sample textures and spritesheets from my own VFXParticlePack asset package are included for free!
Please check it out and consider buying it from the Unity Asset Store if you like it.

It includes a massive collection of HI-RES spritesheets (4096^2px) and complex particle system prefabs.
